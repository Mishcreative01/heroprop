                    Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                
                <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>How does the process work?
</strong><br>The process is very straightforward. If you decide that you would like to sell your house the quickest way
<br>possible, give us a call or send us an e-mail. We will ask you a few questions about your home, schedule
<br>a time to come take a quick look at it, then follow up with an offer.
<br><br>If you accept our offer, we sign an agreement and send it to a title company. The title company will help
<br>identify and clear up any potential issues during the process. Once the title is cleared, you will get your
<br>cash on the date we had both agreed on. Itâ€™s that simple.
<br><br><strong>My house is in very bad condition. Would you still buy it?
</strong><br>Yes, we would still buy it. We will even clean it out. You just take what you want and leave the rest
<br>behind.
<br><br><strong>How long does it take before you can make an offer?
<br></strong>It depends on how fast we can see it! Most of the time, we will make the offer on the spot and bring all
<br>the necessary paperwork to get the process started.
<br><br><strong>How long typically does it take for the house to be sold and for me to receive the money?
<br></strong>Most of our transactions will happen in less than 30 days. It can range from just a few days to a couple
<br>months, it depends on the situation and your timeline. Sometimes there are outstanding loans on a
<br>property or a complicated ownership situation which may take a little longer to settle. But most
<br>properties sell very quickly and smoothly!
<br><br><strong>What about fees?
<br></strong>We do not need to charge any fees to buy your house, since we do not work on commission like real
<br>estate agents do.
<br><br><strong>How much do you think I can get for my property?
<br></strong>There are many factors that go into determining a price for your property. Things like the condition of
<br>your home, how much (if anything) you owe on it and where it is located. All of these factors determine
<br>what we can pay for it. But do not worry about that. You are under no obligation to sell us your home. If
<br>you do not like the price. You can always keep the home or talk to a real estate agent.
<br><br><strong>Will you buy my house occupied with a tenant?
<br></strong>Yes, we can. Many homes we buy have a tenant in place. Just let us know what they are paying for rent,
<br>if they are on time with payments, and any other issues you may have with them.</p>
